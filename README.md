### CS 81 Module 7 Assignment 7A: Code Review, by GregH, 7/20/25

**loadingAnimation.html** includes inline JavaScript which demonstrates the asynchronous function, setInterval(). I added explanatory code comments, a countdown timer, and a code comment describing a creative idea for improvement.

**REFLECTION.md** has my answers to questions about what was confusing, how the code demonstrates asynchronous behavior, and what I changed.
